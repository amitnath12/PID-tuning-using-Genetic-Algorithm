# PID-tuning-using-Genetic-Algorithm

# Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to tune the parameters of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The goal is to find optimal PID gains that will provide desired performance for a given control system. The GA is used to explore the parameter space and optimize the PID controllerâ€™s performance based on a fitness function.

# Project Description
The project includes MATLAB code for tuning PID controller parameters using a Genetic Algorithm. The GA optimizes the PID gains to achieve specific performance criteria such as minimizing overshoot, settling time, or steady-state error.

# Algorithm Details

- # Initialization:

A population of PID gain values is generated randomly.
- # Selection:

Individuals (PID gain sets) are selected based on their fitness scores.
- # Crossover:

New PID gain sets are generated by combining parts of selected individuals.
- # Mutation:
(Optional)
Random adjustments are made to some PID gains to explore new solutions.
- # Fitness Function:

The fitness function evaluates the performance of the PID controller with a given set of gains. This function can be based on metrics such as rise time, overshoot, settling time, or other performance criteria.
